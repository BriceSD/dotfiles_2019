3. Before each new build we need to rollback the patch changes with "revert" operation ![setup3](https://github.com/dboissier/jenkins-control-plugin/blob/master/doc/howto/1_setup_jenkins/03.png?raw=true)

* **Setup from the IDE**

1. Updating the list of jobs i recommend to install in 1 minute for quick notifications of the results of the build ![notification](https://github.com/dboissier/jenkins-control-plugin/blob/master/doc/howto/2_setup_ide/03.png)
